BEING A GOOD PARENT IS, of course. what every parent would like to be. But defining what it means to be a good parent is undoubtedly very 1 tricky , particularly since children respond differently to the same style of parenting. A calm, rule-following[遵守规则的] child might respond better to a different sort of parenting [抚养，养育]than, 	2for example	, a younger sibling[兄弟姐妹].
 	3Fortunately , there's another sort of parent that' s a bit easier to 4describe: a patient parent. Children of every age benefit from patient  parenting. Still,5while	every parent would like to be patient, this is no easy 6task	.Sometimes parents get exhausted and frustrated and are unable maintain a 7tolerant and composed style with their kids. I understand this.

You're only human, and sometimes your kids can 8push  you just a little too far. And then the 9 inevitable(不可避免的) happens: You lose your patience and either scream at your kids or say something that was a bit too 10harsh and does nobody any good. You wish that you could 11turn back the clock and start over. We've all been there.

 	12however, even though it,'s common, it's important to keep in mind that in a single moment of fatigue(疲劳), you can say something to your child that you may 13 regret for a long time. This may not only do damage to your relationship with your child but also 	14affect	your child’s self-esteem(自尊).

If you consistently(一贯的) lose your 15cool with your kids, then you are inadvertently(不经意地) modeling a lack of emotional control for your kids. We are all becoming increasingly aware of the 16 important of modeling tolerance and patience for the younger generation. This is a skill that will help them all throughout life. In fact, the ability to emotionally( 感情上) regulate or maintain emotional control when  17confronted(直面) by stress is one of the most important of all life's skills.

Certainly. it's incredibly（ 极端地）18hard to maintain patience at all times with your children. A more practical goal is to try, to the best of your ability, to be as tolerant and composed as you can when faced with 19trying situations involving your children. I can promise you this: As a result of working toward  this goal,  you and your  children  will  benefit and 20 emerge from stressful moments feeling better physically and emotionally.

Rats and other animals need to be highly attuned( 适应 ) to social signals from others so they can identify friends to cooperate with and enemies to avoid. To find out if this extends to non-living beings, Laleh Quinn and her team at the University of California, San Diego, tested whether rats can detect social signals from robotic rats.

They housed(给提供住处) eight adult rats with two types of robotic rat — one social and one asocial(缺乏社交性的) — for four days. The robot rats were quite basic, resembling [显得像 ; 像 ; resemble的现在分词]a chunkier(厚实的) version of a computer mouse with wheels to move around and colorful markings.

In the experiment, the social robot rat followed the living rats around, played with the same toys and opened cage doors to let rats escape. The asocial robot simply moved forwards and backwards and side to side.

Next, the researchers trapped( 使陷入困境) the robots in cages and gave the rats the chance to release them by pressing a lever.

Across 18 trials(审判) each, the living rats were 52 percent more likely on average to set the social robot free than the asocial one. This suggests the rats perceived the social robot as a genuine() social being. They may have bonded more with the social robot because it took part in communal(共享的) exploring and playing. This could lead to the rats better remembering having freed it earlier, and wanting the robot to return the favour when they get trapped, says Quinn.

The readiness(准备就绪) of the rats to befriend the social robot was surprising given its minimal design. The robot was the same size as a regular rat but resembled a simple plastic box on wheels. “We’d assumed we’d have to give it a moving head and tail(尾巴), facial features(面部特征), and put a scent on it to make it smell like a real rat, but that wasn’t necessary,” says Janet Wiles at the University of Queensland in Australia, who helped with the research.

The finding shows how sensitive rats are to social cues, even when they come from basic robots. Similarly, children tend to treat robots as if they are fellow beings, even when they display only simple social signals. “We humans seem to be fascinated(入迷的) by robots, and it turns out other animals are too.” says Wiles.

21.Quinn and her colleagues conducted a test to see if rats can 	
[A]distinguish a friendly rat from a hostile one
[B]pick up social signals from non-living rats
[C]attain sociable traits through special training
[D]send out warning messages to their fellow

22.What did the social robot do during the experiment?
[A]It played with some toys
[B]It set the trapped rats free
[C]It followed the social robot
[D]It moved around alone

23.According to Quinn, the rats released the social robot because they 	

[A]considered that an interesting game
[B]excepted it to do the same in return
[C]wanted to display their intelligence
[D]tried to practice a means of escape

24.Janet Wiles notes that rats 	
[A]can be scared by plastic box on wheels
[B]differentiate smells better than sizes
[C]respond more to actions than to looks
[D]can remember other rats’ facial features

25.It can be learned from the text that rats 	
[A]appear to be adaptable to new surroundings
[B]are more socially active than other animals
[C]behave differently from children in socializing
[D]are more sensitive to social cues than expected

It is fashionable today to bash Big Business. And there is one issue on which the many critics agree: CEO pay. We hear that CEOs are paid too much (or too much relative to workers), or that they rig others’ pay, or that their pay is insufficiently related to positive outcomes. But the more likely truth is CEO pay is largely caused by intense competition.

It is true that CEO pay has gone up—top ones may make 300 times the pay of typical workers on average, and since the mid-1970s, CEO pay for large publicly traded American corporations has, by varying estimates, gone up by about 500%. The typical CEO of a top American corporation— from the 350 largest such companies—now makes about $18.9 million a year.

While individual cases of overpayment definitely exist, in general, the determinants of CEO pay are not so mysterious and not so mired in corruption. In fact, overall CEO compensation for the top companies rises pretty much in lockstep with the value of those companies on the stock market.

The best model for understanding the growth of CEO pay, though, is that of limited CEO talent in a world where business opportunities for the top firms are growing rapidly. The efforts of America’s highest-earning 1% have been one of the more dynamic elements of the global economy. It’s not popular to say, but one reason their pay has gone up so much is that CEOs really have upped their game relative to many other workers in the U.S. economy.

Today’s CEO, at least for major American firms, must have many more skills than simply being able to “run the company.” CEOs must have a good sense of financial markets and maybe even how the company should trade in them. They also need better public relations skills than their predecessors, as the costs of even a minor slipup can be significant. Then there’s the fact that large American companies are much more globalized than ever before, with supply chains spread across a larger number of countries. To lead in that system requires knowledge that is fairly mind-boggling.

The common idea that high CEO pay is mainly about ripping people off doesn’t explain history very well. By most measures, corporate governance has become a lot tighter and more rigorous since the 1970s. Yet it is principally during this period of stronger governance that CEO pay has been high and rising. That suggests it is in the broader corporate interest to recruit top candidates for increasingly tough jobs.

Furthermore, the highest CEO salaries are paid to outside candidates, not to the cozy insider picks, another sign that high CEO pay is not some kind of depredation at the expense of the rest of the company. And the stock market reacts positively when companies tie CEO pay to, say, stock prices, a sign that those practices build up corporate value not just for the CEO.

26.which of the following has contributed to CEO pay rise?
[A]The growth in the number of cooperation
[B]The general pay rise with a better economy
[C]Increased business opportunities for top firms
[D]Close cooperation among leading economics

27.Compared with their predecessors, today's CEOs are required to 	
[A]foster a stronger sense of teamwork
[B]finance more research and development
[C]establish closer ties with tech companies
[D]operate more globalized companies

28.CEO pay has been rising since the 1970s despite 	
[A]continual internal opposition
[B]strict corporate governance
[C]conservative business strategies
[D]repeated governance warnings

29.High CEO pay can be justified by the fact that it helps 	
[A]confirm the status of CEOs
[B]motive inside candidates
[C]boost the efficiency of CEOs
[D]increase corporate value

30.The most suitable title for this text would be 	
[A]CEOs Are Not Overpaid
[B]CEO Pay: Past and Present
[C]CEOs' Challenges of Today
[D]CEO Traits: Not Easy to Define

Madrid was hailed as a public health beacon last November when it rolled out ambitious restrictions on the most polluting cars. Seven months and one election day later, a new conservative city council suspended enforcement of the clean air zone, a first step toward its possible demise.

Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida made opposition to the zone a centrepiece of his election campaign, despite its success in improving air quality. A judge has now overruled the city’s decision to stop levying fines, ordering them reinstated. But with legal battles ahead, the zone’s future looks uncertain at best.

Madrid’s back and forth on clean air is a pointed reminder of the limits to the patchwork, city- by-city approach that characterises efforts on air pollution across Europe, Britain very much included.

Among other weaknesses, the measures cities must employ when left to tackle dirty air on their own are politically contentious, and therefore vulnerable. That’s because they inevitably put the costs of cleaning the air on to individual drivers – who must pay fees or buy better vehicles – rather than on to the car manufacturers whose cheating is the real cause of our toxic pollution.

It’s not hard to imagine a similar reversal happening in London. The new ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) is likely to be a big issue in next year’s mayoral election. And if Sadiq Khan wins and extends it to the North and South Circular roads in 2021 as he intends, it is sure to spark intense opposition from the far larger number of motorists who will then be affected.

It’s not that measures such as London’s Ulez are useless. Far from it. Local officials are using the levers that are available to them to safeguard residents’ health in the face of a serious threat. The zones do deliver some improvements to air quality, and the science tells us that means real health benefits–fewer heart attacks, strokes and premature births, less cancer, dementia and asthma. Fewer untimely deaths.

But mayors and councillors can only do so much about a problem that is far bigger than any one city or town. They are acting because national governments – Britain’s and others across Europe
– have failed to do so.


Restrictions that keep highly polluting cars out of certain areas–city centres, “school streets”, even individual roads – are a response to the absence of a larger effort to properly enforce existing regulations and require auto companies to bring their vehicles into compliance. Wales has introduced special low speed limits to minimise pollution. We’re doing everything but insist that manufacturers clean up their cars.

31.Which of the following is true about Madrid’s clean air zone?
[A]Its effects are questionable.
[B]It has been opposed by a judge.
[C]Its fate is yet to be decided.
[D]It needs tougher enforcement.

32.Which is considered a weakness of the city-level measures to tackle dirty air?
[A]They are biased against car manufacturers.
[B]They prove impractical for city councils.
[C]They are deemed too mild for politicians.
[D]They put too much burden on individual motorists.

33.The author believes that the extension of London’s Ulez will 	.
[A]arouse strong resistance.
[B]ensure Khan’s electoral success.
[C]improve the city’s traffic.
[D]discourage car manufacturing.

34.Who does the author think should have addressed the problem?
[A]Local residents
[B]Mayors.
[C]Councilors.
[D]National governments.

35.It can be inferred from the last paragraph that auto companies 	.
[A]will raise low-emission car production
[B]should be forced to follow regulations
[C]will upgrade the design of their vehicles
[D]should be put under public supervision

Now that members of Generation Z are graduating college this spring—the most commonly- accepted definition says this generation was born after 1995, give or take a year—the attention has been rising steadily in recent weeks. GenZs are about to hit the streets looking for work in a labor market that's tighter than it's been in decades. And employers are planning on hiring about 17 percent more new graduates for jobs in the U.S. this year than last, according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Everybody wants to know how the people who will soon inhabit those empty office cubicles will differ from those who came before them.

If "entitled" is the most common adjective, fairly or not, applied to millennials (those born between 1981 and 1995), the catchwords for Generation Z are practical and cautious. According to the career counselors and experts who study them, Generation Zs are clear-eyed, economic pragmatists. Despite graduating into the best economy in the past 50 years, Gen Zs know what an economic train wreck looks like. They were impressionable kids during the crash of 2008, when many of their parents lost their jobs or their life savings or both. They aren't interested in taking any chances. The booming economy seems to have done little to assuage this underlying generational sense of anxious urgency, especially for those who have college debt. College loan balances in the U.S. now stand at a record $1.5 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.

One survey from Accenture found that 88 percent of graduating seniors this year chose their major with a job in mind. In a 2019 survey of University of Georgia students, meanwhile, the career office found the most desirable trait in a future employer was the ability to offer secure employment (followed by professional development and training, and then inspiring purpose). Job security or stability was the second most important career goal (work-life balance was number one), followed by a sense of being dedicated to a cause or to feel good about serving the greater good.

That's a big change from the previous generation. "Millennials wanted more flexibility in their lives," notes Tanya Michelsen, Associate Director of YouthSight, a UK-based brand manager that conducts regular 60-day surveys of British youth, in findings that might just as well apply to American youth. "Generation Z are looking for more certainty and stability, because of the rise of the gig economy. They have trouble seeing a financial future and they are quite risk averse."

36.Generation Zs graduating college this spring 	
[A]are recognized for their abilities.
[B]are optimistic about the labor market.
[C]are in favor of office job offers.
[D]are drawing growing public attention.

37.Generation Zs are keenly aware 	
[A]what their parents expect of them
[B]how valuable a counselor’s advice is
[C]what a tough economic situation is like
[D]how they differ from past generation

38.assuage (line 9 paragraph 2)  	
[A]deepen
[B]define

[C]maintain
[D]relieve

39.It can be learned from Para. 3 that Generation Zs 	
[A]give top priority to professional training
[B]have a clear idea about their future jobs
[C]care little about their job performance
[D]think it hard to achieve work-life balance

40.Michelsen thinks that compared with millennials, Generation Zs are 	.
[A]less realistic
[B]less adventurous
[C]more diligent
[D]more generous

Five ways to Win Over Everyone in the office


Is it possible to like everyone in your office? Think about how tough it is to get together 15 people, much less 50, who all get along perfectly. But unlike in friendships, you need coworkers. You work with them every day, and whether they’re your boss, direct report or equal, you depend on them just as they depend on you.

Here are some ways, based on psychological research and advice from career experts, that you can get the whole office on your side.

41.__________________________

If you have a bone to pick with someone in your workplace, you may try to stay tight-lipped around them. But you won’t be helping either one of you. Psychological research shows that people tend to prefer others who reveal information about themselves, rather than conceal it. A Harvard Business School study found that observers consistently rated those who were upfront about themselves more highly, while those who hid lost trustworthiness. This idea extends to the office: The same study found that employers were more likely to pick candidates who said they had done drugs over those who said no or chose not to answer. The lesson is not that you should make your personal life an open book, but rather, when given the option to offer up details about yourself or studiously stash them away, you should just be honest.

42._________________

Just as important as being honest about yourself is being receptive to others. We often feel the need to tell others how we feel, whether it’s a concern about a project, a stray thought, or a compliment. Those are all valid, but you need to take time to hear out your coworkers, too. “Rushing to get your own ideas out there can cause colleagues to feel you don’t value their opinions,” Rita Friedman, a career coach, told Forbes. Do your best to engage coworkers in a genuine, back-and- forth conversation, rather than prioritizing your own thoughts.

43.__________________

It’s common to have a “cubicle mate” or special confidant in a work setting. But in addition to those trusted coworkers, you should expand your horizons and find out about all the people around you. Use your lunch and coffee breaks to meet up with colleagues you don’t always see. Find out about their lives and interests beyond the job. It requires minimal effort and goes a long way. “This will help to grow your internal network, in addition to being a nice break in the work day,” Ryan Kahn, a career coach and author of Hired! The Guide for the Recent Grad, told Forbes.

44._____________________

Positive feedback is important for anyone to hear. And you don’t have to be someone’s boss to tell them they did an exceptional job on a particular project, or offer thanks for help. This will help engender good will in others. But don’t overdo it or be fake about it. Studies have found that lavishing people with a torrent of praise doesn’t work nearly as well as providing a mix of positive and negative feedback. One study in particular found that people responded best to comments that shifted from negative to positive, possibly because it suggested they had won somebody over.

45.______________________

This one may be a bit more difficult to pull off, but it can go a long way to achieving results. Remember in dealing with any coworker what they appreciate from an interaction. Watch out for how they verbalize with others. Some people like small talk in a meeting before digging into important matters, while others are more straightforward. Jokes that work on one person won’t necessarily land with another. Tailor your style accordingly to type. “Consider the person that you’re dealing with before each interaction and what will get you to your desired outcome,” Kahn said.


Section III	Translation

46.Directions：

Translate the following text into Chinese. Write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET. (15 points)

It’s almost impossible to go through life without experiencing some kind of failure. But, the wonderful thing about failure is that it’s entirely up to us to decide how to look at it. We can choose to see failure as "the end of the world,". Or we can look at failure as the incredible learning experience that it often is. Every time we fail at something, we can choose to look for the lesson we're meant to learn. These lessons are very important; they’re how we grow, and how we keep from making that same mistake again. Failures stop us only if we let them.

Failure can also teach us things about ourselves that we would never have learned otherwise. For instance, failure can help you discover how strong a person you are. Failing at something can help you discover your truest friends, or help you find unexpected motivation to succeed.

Weighing yourself regularly is a wonderful way to stay aware of any significant weight fluctuations. 	1	,when done too often, this habit can sometimes hurt more than it 	2	.
As for me, weighing myself every day caused me to shift my focus from being generally healthy and physically active to focusing 	3	on the scale. That was bad to my overall  fitness
goals. I had gained weight in the form of muscle mass, but thinking  only of 	4	the number on the scale, I altered my training program. That conflicted with how I needed to train to 	5	my goals.

I also found that weighing myself daily  did not provide an accurate 	6	of the hard work and progress I was making in the gym. It takes about three weeks to a month to notice significant changes in your weight 	7	altering your training program. The most 	8	changes will be
observed in skill level, strength and inches lost.

For these 	9	, I stopped weighing myself every day and switched to a bimonthly weighing schedule 	10	. Since weight loss is not my goal, it is less important for me to 	11	my weight each week. Weighing  every other week  allows me  to observe and 	12	an significant weight changes. That tells me whether I need to 	13	my training program.

I use my  bimonthly weigh-in 	14	to get information about my nutrition as well. If my training intensity remains the same, but I’m constantly 	15	and  dropping weight,  this  is a 16	that I need to increase my daily caloric intake.

The 	17	to stop weighing myself every day has done wonders for my overall health, fitness and well-being. I’m experiencing increased zeal for working out since I no longer carry the burden of a 	18	morning weigh-in. I've also experienced greater success in achieving my specific fitness goals,   19	I'm training according to those goals, instead of numbers on a scale.

Rather than 	20	over the scale, turn your focus to how you look, feel, how your clothes

fit and your overall energy level.

Unlike so-called basic emotions such as sadness, fear, and anger, guilt emerges a little later, in conjunction with a child’s growing grasp of social and moral norms. Children aren’t born knowing how to say "I’m sorry"; rather, they learn over time that such statements appease parents and friends
— and their own consciences. This is why researchers generally regard so-called moral guilt, in the right amount, to be a good thing.

In the popular imagination, of course, guilt still gets a bad rap. It is deeply uncomfortable— it’s the emotional equivalent of wearing a jacket weighted with stones. Yet this understanding is outdated. "There has been a kind of revival or a rethinking about what guilt is and what role guilt can serve," says Amrisha Vaish, a psychology researchers at the University of Virginia, adding that this revival is part of a larger recognition that emotions aren’t binary—feelings that may be advantageous in one context may be harmful in another. Jealousy and anger, for example, may have evolved to alert us to important inequalities. Too much happiness can be destructive.

And guilt, by prompting us to think more deeply about our goodness, can encourage humans to make up for errors and fix relationships. Guilt, in other words, can help hold a cooperative species together. It is a kind of social glue.

Viewed in this light, guilt is an opportunity. Work by Tina Malti, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, suggests that guilt may compensate for an emotional deficiency. In a number of studies, Malti and others have shown that guilt and sympathy may represent different pathways to cooperation and sharing. Some kids who are low in sympathy may make up for that shortfall by experiencing more guilt, which can rein in their nastier impulses. And vice versa: High sympathy can substitute for low guilt.

In a 2014 study, for example, Malti looked at 244 children. Using caregiver assessments and the children’s self-observations, she rated each child's overall sympathy level and his or her tendency to feel negative emotions after moral transgressions. Then the kids were handed chocolate coins,and given a chance to share them with an anonymous child. For the low-sympathy kids, how much they shared appeared to turn on how inclined they were to feel guilty. The guilt-prone ones shared more, even though they hadn’t magically become more sympathetic to the other child’s deprivation.

“That’s good news, ” Malti says. “We can be prosocial because we caused harm and we feel regret. ”

21.Researchers think that guilt can be a good thing because it may help 	.
[A]regulate a child’s basic emotions
[B]improve a child’s intellectual ability
[C]intensify a child’s positive feelings
[D]foster a child’s moral development

22.According to Paragraph 2, many people still consider guilt to be	.
[A]deceptive
[B]addictive
[C]burdensome
[D]inexcusable

23.Vaish holds that the rethinking about guilt comes from an awareness that	.
[A]an emotion can play opposing roles
[B]emotions are socially constructive
[C]emotional stability can benefit health
[D]emotions are context–independent

24.Malti and others have shown that cooperation and sharing	.
[A]may help correct emotional deficiencies
[B]can bring about emotional satisfaction
[C]can result from either sympathy or guilt
[D]may be the outcome of impulsive acts

25.The word "transgressions" (Line 3 Para. 5) is closest in meaning to	.

Forests give us shade, quiet and one of the harder challenges in the fight against climate change. Even as we humans count on forests to soak up a good share of the carbon dioxide we produce, we are threatening their ability to do so. The climate change we are hastening could one day leave us with forests that emit more carbon than they absorb.

Thankfully, there is a way out of this trap—but it involves striking a subtle balance. Helping forests flourish as valuable "carbon sinks" long into the future may require reducing their capacity to absorb carbon now. California is leading the way, as it does on so many climate efforts, in figuring out the details.

The state’s proposed Forest Carbon Plan aims to double efforts to thin out young trees and clear brush in parts of the forest. This temporarily lowers carbon-carrying capacity. But the remaining trees draw a greater share of the available moisture, so they grow and thrive, restoring the forest's capacity to pull carbon from the air. Healthy trees are also better able to fend off bark insects. The landscape is rendered less burnable. Even in the event of a fire, fewer trees are consumed.

The need for such planning is increasingly urgent. Already, since 2010, drought and insects have killed over 100 million trees in California, most of them in 2016 alone, and wildfires have scorched hundreds of thousands of acres.

California plans to treat 35,000 acres of forest a year by 2020, and 60,000 by 2030—financed from the proceeds of the state's emissions-permit auctions. That's only a small share of the total acreage that could benefit, about half a million acres in all, so it will be vital to prioritize areas at greatest risk of fire or drought.

The strategy also aims to ensure that carbon in woody material removed from the forests is locked away in the form of solid lumber or burned as biofuel in vehicles that would otherwise run on fossil fuels. New research on transportation biofuels is under way.

State governments are well accustomed to managing forests, but traditionally they've focused on wildlife, watersheds and opportunities for recreation. Only recently have they come to see the vital part forests will have to play in storing carbon. California's plan, which is expected to be finalized by the governor next year, should serve as a model.

American farmers have been complaining of labor shortages for several years. The complaints are unlikely to stop without an overhaul of immigration rules for farm workers.

Congress has obstructed efforts to create a more straightforward visa for agricultural workers that would let foreign workers stay longer in the U.S. and change jobs within the industry. If this doesn’t change, American businesses, communities and consumers will be the losers.

Perhaps half of U.S. farm laborers are undocumented immigrants. As fewer such workers enter the country, the characteristics of the agricultural workforce are changing. Today’s farm laborers, while still predominantly born in Mexico, are more likely to be settled rather than migrating, and more likely to be married than single. They are also aging. At the start of this century, about one- third of crop workers were over the age of 35. Now more than half are. And picking crops is hard on older bodies. One oft-debated cure for this labor shortage remains as implausible as it has been all along: Native U.S. workers won' t be returning to the farm.

Mechanization isn’t the answer, either not yet, at least. Production of corn, cotton, rice, soybeans and wheat have been largely mechanized, but many high-value, labor-intensive crops, such as strawberries, need labor. Even dairy farms, where robots do a small share of milking, have a long way to go before they’re automated.

As a result, farms have grown increasingly reliant on temporary guest workers using the H-2A visa to fill the gaps in the workforce. Starting around 2012, requests for the visas rose sharply; from 2011 to 2016 the number of visas issued more than doubled.

The H-2A visa has no numerical cap, unlike the H-2B visa for nonagricultural work, which is limited to 66,000 a year. Even so, employers complain that they aren’t given all the workers they need. The process is cumbersome, expensive and unreliable. One survey found that bureaucratic delays led H-2A workers to arrive on the job 22 days late. The shortage is compounded by federal immigration raids, which remove some workers and drive others underground.

In a 2012 survey, 71 percent of tree-fruit growers and almost 80 percent of raisin and berry growers said they were short of labor. Some western farmers have responded by moving operations to Mexico. From 1998 to 2000, 14.5 percent of the fruit Americans consumed was imported. Little more than a decade later, the share of imports was 25.8 percent. In effect, the U.S. can import food or it can import the workers who pick it.


31.What problem should be addressed according to the first two paragraphs?
[A]Discrimination against foreign workers in the U.S.
[B]Biased laws in favor of some American businesses.
[C]Flaws in U.S. immigration rules for farm workers.
[D]Decline of job opportunities in U.S. agriculture.

32.One trouble with U.S. agricultural workforce is 	.
[A]The rising number of illegal immigrants
[B]The high mobility of crop workers
[C]The lack of experienced laborers

[D]The aging of immigrant farm workers

33.What is the much-argued solution to the labor shortage in U.S. farming?
[A]To attract younger laborers to farm work.
[B]To get native U.S. workers back to farming.
[C]To use more robots to grow high-value crops.
[D]To strengthen financial support for farmers.

34.Agricultural employers complain about the H-2A visa for its 	.
[A]slow granting procedures
[B]limit on duration of stay
[C]tightened requirements
[D]control of annual admissions

35.Which of the following could be the best title for this text?
[A]U.S. Agriculture in Decline?
[B]Import Food or Labor?
[C]America Saved by Mexico?
[D]Manpower vs. Automation?

Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dia Mirza and Adrian Grenier have a message for you: It’s easy to beat plastic. They’re part of a bunch of celebrities starring in a new video for World Environment Day—encouraging you, the consumer, to swap out your single-use plastic staples like straws and cutlery to combat the plastic crisis.

The key messages that have been put together for World Environment Day do include a call for governments to enact legislation to curb single-use plastics. But the overarching message is directed at individuals.
My concern with leaving it up to the individual, however, is our limited sense of what needs to be achieved. On their own, taking our own bags to the grocery store or quitting plastic straws，for example, will accomplish little and require very little of us. They could even be harmful, satisfying a need to have "done our bit" without ever progressing onto bigger, bolder, more effective actions— a kind of "moral licensing" that eases our concerns and stops us doing more and asking more of those in charge.


While the conversation around our environment and our responsibility toward it remains centered on shopping bags and straws, we’re ignoring the balance of power that implies that as "consumers" we must shop sustainably, rather than as "citizens" hold our governments and industries to account to push for real systemic change.

It’s important to acknowledge that the environment isn’t everyone’s priority—or even most people’s. We shouldn’t expect it to be. In her latest book, Why Good People Do Bad Environmental Things, Elizabeth R. DeSombre argues that the best way to collectively change the behavior of large numbers of people is for the change to be structural.

This might mean implementing policy such as a plastic tax that adds a cost to environmentally problematic action, or banning single-use plastics altogether. India has just announced it will "eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022." There are also incentive-based ways of making better environmental choices easier, such as ensuring recycling is at least as easy as trash disposal.

DeSombre isn’t saying people should stop caring about the environment. It’s just that individual actions are too slow, she says, for that to be only, or even primary, approach to changing widespread behavior.

None of this is about writing off the individual. It’s just about putting things into perspective. We don' t have time to wait. We need progressive policies that shape collective action, alongside engaged citizens pushing for change.

36.Some celebrities star in a new video to 	.
[A]demand new laws on the use of plastics
[B]urge consumers to cut the use of plastics
[C]invite public opinion on the plastics crisis
[D]disclose the causes of the plastics crisis

37.The author is concerned that "moral licensing" may 	.
[A]mislead us into doing worthless things
[B]prevent us from making further efforts
[C]weaken our sense of accomplishment
[D]suppress our desire for success

38.By pointing out our identity as "citizens," the author indicates that 	.
[A]our focus should be shifted to community welfare
[B]our relationship with local industries is improving
[C]we have been actively exercising our civil rights
[D]we should press our governments to lead the combat

39.DeSombre argues that the best way for a collective change should be 	.
[A]a win-win arrangement
[B]a self-driven mechanism
[C]a cost- effective approach
[D]a top-down process

40.The author concludes that individual efforts 	.
[A]can be too aggressive
[B]are far from sufficient
[C]can be too inconsistent
[D]are far from rational

How seriously should parents take kids' opinions when searching for a home?

In choosing a new home, Camille McClain's kids have a single demand: a backyard.

McClain’s little ones aren't the only kids who have an opinion when it comes to housing, and in many cases youngsters' views weigh heavily on parents' real estate decisions, according to a 2018 Harris Poll survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults.
While more families buck an older generation proclivity to leave kids in the dark about real estate decisions, realty agents and psychologists have mixed views about the financial, personal and long-term effects kids' opinions may have.
The idea of involving children in a big decision is a great idea because it can help them feel a sense of control and ownership in what can be an overwhelming process, said Ryan Hooper, a clinical psychologist in Chicago.
“Children may face serious difficulties in coping with significant moves, especially if it removes them from their current school or support system," he said.
Greg Jaroszewski, a real estate broker with Gagliardo Realty Associates, said he’s not

convinced that kids should be involved in selecting a home—but their opinions should be considered in regards to proximity to friends and social activities, if possible.
Younger children should feel like they're choosing their home—without actually getting a choice in the matter, said Adam Bailey, a real state attorney based in New York.
Asking them questions about what they like about the backyard of a potential home will make them feel like they're being included in the decision-making process, Bailey said.
Many of the aspects of homebuying aren’t a consideration for children, said Tracey Hampson, a real estate agent based in Santa Clarita, Clalif. And placing too much emphasis on their opinions can ruin a fantastic home purchase.
“Speaking with your children before you make a real estate decision is wise, but I wouldn't base the purchasing decision solely on their opinions," Hampson said.

The other issue is that many children—especially older ones—may base their real estate knowledge on HGTV shows, said Aaron Norris of The Norris Group in Riverside, Calif."
They love Chip and Joana Gaines just as much as the rest of us," he said. “ HGTV has seriously changed how people view real estate .It's not shelter, it's a lifestyle. With that mindset change come some serious money consequences."
Kids tend to get stuck in the features and the immediate benefits to them personally, Norris said.

Parents need to remind their children that their needs and desires may change over time, said Julie Gurner, a real estate analyst with FitSmallBusiness.com.
“ Their opinions can change tomorrow,” Gurner said. “ Harsh as it may be to say, that decision should likely not be made contingent on a child's opinions, but rather made for them with great consideration into what home can meet their needs best — and give them an opportunity to customize it a bit and make it their own. ”
This advice is more relevant now than ever before, even as more parents want to embrace the ideas of their children, despite the current housing crunch.

A. notes that aspects like children's friends and social activities
should be considered upon homebuying.

41. Ryan Hooper		B. believes that homebuying decisions should be based on
children's needs rather than their opinions.

It is easy to underestimate English writer James Herriot. He had such a pleasant, readable style that one might think that anyone could imitate it. How many times have I heard people say, “I could write a book, I just haven’t the time.” Easily said. Not so easily done. James Herriot, contrary to popular opinion, did not find it easy in his early days of, as he put it, “having a go at the writing game”. While he obviously had an abundance of natural talent, the final, polished work that he gave to the world was the result of years of practicing, re-writing and reading. Like the majority of authors, he had to suffer many disappointments and rejections along the way, but these made him all the more determined to succeed. Everything he achieved in life was earned the hard way and his success in the literary field was no exception.

Text 1

It is curious that Stephen Koziatek feels almost as though he has to justify his efforts to give his students a better future.

Mr. Koziatek is part of something pioneering. He is a teacher at a New Hampshire high school where learning is not something of books and tests and mechanical memorization, but practical. When did it become accepted wisdom that students should be able to name the 13th president of the United States but be utterly overwhelmed by a busted bike chain?

As Koziatek knows, there is learning in just about everything. Nothing is necessarily gained by forcing students to learn geometry at a graffitied desk stuck with generations of discarded chewing gum. They can also learn geometry by assembling a bicycle.

But he’s also found a kind of insidious prejudice. Working with your hands is seen as almost a mark of inferiority. Schools in the family of vocational education “have that stereotype...that it’s for kids who can’t make it academically,” he says.

On one hand, that viewpoint is a logical product of America’s evolution. Manufacturing is not the economic engine that it once was. The job security that the U.S. economy once offered to high school graduates has largely evaporated. More education is the new principle. We want more for our kids, and rightfully so.

But the headlong push into bachelor’s degrees for all—and the subtle devaluing of anything less—misses an important point: That’s not the only thing the American economy needs. Yes, a bachelor’s degree opens more doors. But even now, 54 percent of the jobs in the country are middle- skill jobs, such as construction and high-skill manufacturing. But only 44 percent of workers are adequately trained.

In other words, at a time when the working class has turned the country on its political head, frustrated that the opportunity that once defined America is vanishing, one obvious solution is staring us in the face. There is a gap in working-class jobs, but the workers who need those jobs most aren’t equipped to do them. Koziatek’s Manchester School of Technology High School is trying to fill that gap.

Koziatek’s school is a wake-up call. When education becomes one-size-fits-all, it risks overlooking a nation’s diversity of gifts.

21.A broken bike chain is mentioned to show students’ lack of	.
[A]academic training
[B]practical ability
[C]pioneering spirit
[D]mechanical memorization

22.There exists the prejudice that vocational education is for kids who	.

While fossil fuels—coal, oil, gas—still generate roughly 85 percent of the world’s energy supply, it's clearer than ever that the future belongs to renewable sources such as wind and solar. The move to renewables is picking up momentum around the world: They now account for more than half of new power sources going on line.

Some growth stems from a commitment by governments and farsighted businesses to fund cleaner energy sources. But increasingly the story is about the plummeting prices of renewables，especially wind and solar. The cost of solar panels has dropped by 80 percent and the cost of wind turbines by close to one-third in the past eight years.

In many parts of the world renewable energy is already a principal energy source. In Scotland， for example, wind turbines provide enough electricity to power 95 percent of homes. While the rest of the world takes the lead, notably China and Europe, the United States is also seeing a remarkable shift. In March, for the first time, wind and solar power accounted for more than 10 percent of the power generated in the U.S., reported the US Energy Information Administration.


President Trump has underlined fossil fuels—especially coal—as the path to economic growth. In a recent speech in Iowa, he dismissed wind power as an unreliable energy source. But that message did not play well with many in Iowa, where wind turbines dot the fields and provide 36 percent of the state’s electricity generation—and where tech giants like Microsoft are being attracted by the availability of clean energy to power their data centers.

The question “what happens when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine?” has provided a quick put-down for skeptics. But a boost in the storage capacity of batteries is making

The advance is driven in part by vehicle manufacturers, who are placing big bets on battery- powered electric vehicles. Although electric cars are still a rarity on roads now, this massive investment could change the picture rapidly in coming years.

While there’s a long way to go, the trend lines for renewables are spiking. The pace of change in energy sources appears to be speeding up—perhaps just in time to have a meaningful effect in slowing climate change. What Washington does—or doesn’t do—to promote alternative energy may mean less and less at a time of a global shift in thought.

26.The word “plummeting”（Line 2，Para. 2）is closest in meaning to 	.
[A]stabilizing
[B]changing
[C]falling
[D]rising

27.According to Paragraph 3，the use of renewable energy in America 	.
[A]is progressing notably
[B]is as extensive as in Europe
[C]faces many challenges
[D]has proved to be impractical

28.It can be learned that in Iowa, 	.
[A]wind is a widely used energy source
[B]wind energy has replaced fossil fuels
[C]tech giants are investing in clean energy
[D]there is a shortage of clean energy supply

29.Which of the following is true about clean energy according to Paragraphs 5&6? 	.
[A]Its application has boosted battery storage.
[B]It is commonly used in car manufacturing.
[C]Its continuous supply is becoming a reality.
[D]Its sustainable exploitation will remain difficult.

30.It can be inferred from the last paragraph that renewable energy 	.
[A]will bring the US closer to other countries
[B]will accelerate global environmental change
[C]is not really encouraged by the US government
[D]is not competitive enough with regard to its cost

The power and ambition of the giants of the digital economy is astonishing—Amazon has just announced the purchase of the upmarket grocery chain Whole Foods for$13.5bn，but two years ago Facebook paid even more than that to acquire the WhatsApp messaging service, which doesn’t have any physical product at all. What WhatsApp offered Facebook was an intricate and finely detailed web of its users’ friendships and social lives．
Facebook promised the European commission then that it would not link phone numbers to

Facebook identities, but it broke the promise almost as soon as the deal went through. Even without knowing what was in the messages, the knowledge of who sent them and to whom was enormously revealing and still could be. What political journalist, what party whip, would not want to know the makeup of the WhatsApp groups in which Theresa May’s enemies are currently plotting? It may be that the value of Whole Foods to Amazon is not so much the 460 shops it owns, but the records of which customers have purchased what.

Competition law appears to be the only way to address these imbalances of power. But it is clumsy. For one thing, it is very slow compared to the pace of change within the digital economy. By the time a problem has been addressed and remedied it may have vanished in the marketplace, to be replaced by new abuses of power. But there is a deeper conceptual problem, too. Competition law as presently interpreted deals with financial disadvantage to consumers and this is not obvious when the users of these services don’t pay for them. The users of their services are not their customers. That would be the people who buy advertising from them—and Facebook and Google, the two virtual giants, dominate digital advertising to the disadvantage of all other media and entertainment companies．

The product they’re selling is data, and we, the users, convert our lives to data for the benefit of the digital giants. Just as some ants farm the bugs called aphids for the honeydew they produce when they  feed,  so Google  farms us for the data  that our digital lives yield. Ants keep predatory insects away from where their aphids feed; Gmail keeps the spammers out of our inboxes. It doesn’t feel like a human or democratic relationship, even if both sides benefit．
31.According to Paragraph 1, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for its 	.
[A]digital products
[B]user information
[C]physical assets
[D]quality service

32.Linking phone numbers to Facebook identities may 	.
[A]worsen political disputes
[B]mess up customer records
[C]pose a risk to Facebook users
[D]mislead the European commission

33.According to the author, competition law 	.
[A]should serve the new market powers
[B]may worsen the economic imbalance
[C]should not provide just one legal solution
[D]cannot keep pace with the changing market

34.Competition law as presently interpreted can hardly protect Facebook users because 	.
[A]they are not defined as customers
[B]they are not financially reliable
[C]the services are generally digital
[D]the services are paid for by advertisers

35.The ants analogy is used to illustrate 	.
[A]a win-win business model between digital giants

[B]a typical competition pattern among digital giants
[C]the benefits provided for digital giants’ customers
[D]the relationship between digital giants and their users

To combat the trap of putting a premium on being busy, Cal Newport, author of Deep work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted world, recommends building a habit of “deep work”— the ability to focus without distraction.

There are a number of approaches to mastering the art of deep work—be it lengthy retreats dedicated to a specific task; developing a daily ritual; or taking a “journalistic” approach to seizing moments of deep work when you can throughout the day. Whichever approach, the key is to determine your length of focus time and stick to it.

Newport also recommends “deep scheduling” to combat constant interruptions and get more done in less time. “At any given point, I should have deep work scheduled for roughly the next month. Once on the calendar, I protect this time like I would a doctor’s appointment or important meeting”, he writes.

Another approach to getting more done in less time is to rethink how you prioritize your day— in particular how we craft our to-do lists. Tim Harford, author of Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives, points to a study in the early 1980s that divided undergraduates into two groups: some were advised to set out monthly goals and study activities; others were told to plan activities and goals in much more detail, day by day.

While the researchers assumed that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective when it came to the execution of tasks, they were wrong: the detailed daily plans demotivated students. Harford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to-do list ineffective, while leaving room for improvisation in such a list can reap the best results.

In order to make the most of our focus and energy, we also need to embrace downtime, or as Newport suggests, “be lazy.”
“Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to be brain as Vitamin D is to the body...[idleness]is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done,” he argues. Srini Pillay, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, believes this counter-intuitive link between downtime and productivity may be due to the way our brains operate.

Five Ways to Make Conversation with Anyone

Conversations are links, which means when you have a conversation with a new person a link gets formed and every conversation you have after that moment will strengthen the link.
You meet new people every day: the grocery worker, the cab driver, new people at work or the security guard at the door. Simply starting a conversation with them will form a link.
Here are five simple ways that you can make the first move and start a conversation with strangers.
41. ___________________	

Suppose you are in a room with someone you don’t know and something within you says “I want to talk with this person”—this is something that mostly happens with all of us. You wanted to say something—the first word—but it just won’t come out, it feels like it is stuck somewhere. I know the feeling and here is my advice just get it out.
Just think: what is the worst that could happen? They won’t talk with you? Well, they are not talking with you now!
I truly believe that once you get that first word out everything else will just flow. So keep it simple: “Hi”, “Hey” or “Hello”—do the best you can to gather all of the enthusiasm and energy you can, put on a big smile and say “Hi”.
42. 	__________________	

It’s a problem all of us face: you have limited time with the person that you want to talk with and you want to make this talk memorable.
Honestly, if we got stuck in the rut of “hi”, “hello”, “how are you?” and “what’s going on?” you will fail to give the initial jolt to the conversation that can make it so memorable.
So don’t be afraid to ask more personal questions. Trust me, you’ll be surprised to see how much people are willing to share if you just ask.
43. 	__________________	

When you meet a person for the first time, make an effort to find the things which you and that person have in common so that you can build the conversation from that point. When you start conversation from there and then move outwards, you’ll find all of a sudden that the conversation becomes a lot easier.
44. 	__________________	

Imagine you are pouring your heart out to someone and they are just busy on their phone, and if you ask for their attention you get the response “I can multitask”.
So when someone tries to communicate with you, just be in that communication wholeheartedly. Make eye contact. Trust me, eye contact is where all the magic happens. When you make eye contact, you can feel the conversation.
45. 	__________________	

You all came into a conversation where you first met the person, but after some time you may have met again and havo0e forgotten their name. Isn’t that awkward! So, remember the little details of the people you met or you talked with; perhaps the places they have been to, the places they want to go, the things they like, the things they hate — whatever you talk about.
When you remember such things you can automatically become investor in their wellbeing. So they feel a responsibility to you to keep that relationship going.
That’s it. Five amazing ways that you can make conversation with almost anyone. Every person is a really good book to read, or to have a conversation with!


Section III Translation


46.Directions:

In this section there is a text in English. Translate the text into Chinese and write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET. (15 points)
A fifth grader gets a homework assignment to select his future career path from a list of occupations. He ticks “astronaut” but quickly adds “scientist” to the list and selects it as well. The boy is convinced that if he reads enough, he can explore as many career paths as he likes. And so he reads—everything from encyclopedias to science fiction novels. He reads so passionately that his parents have to institute a “no reading policy” at the dinner table.

That boy was Bill Gates, and he hasn’t stopped reading yet—not even after becoming one of the most successful people on the planet. Nowadays, his reading material has changed from science fiction and reference books: recently, he revealed that he reads at least 50 nonfiction books a year. Gates chooses nonfiction titles because they explain how the world works. “Each book opens up new avenues of knowledge,” Gates says.
